# Predicting-Concrete-Compressive-Strength-Project
This is a project for a Machine Learning Course. The dataset that I chose for this project consists of data from 1030 concrete samples. The data belongs to Prof. I-Cheng Yeh from Chung-Hua University. The link to the data is below:

The compressive strength of concrete depends on the ingredients put into the mix and the age of the concrete. Concrete is the second most common substance on Earth after water, and it is the most consumed material globally. More than 7 billion cubic meters of concrete are produced annually. Compressive strength is typically the most important factor under consideration when performing R&D on new concrete mixes. My day job is teaching technicians how to test fresh and hardened concrete, so I thought this would be an interesting topic to work with.

This dataset includes 8 input variables. Seven of these variables are ingredients: cement, slag cement, flyash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate, all in kg per cubic meter. The 8th input variable is the age of the concrete in days. The output is the compressive strength of the concrete in MPa.
